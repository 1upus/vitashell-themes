VitaShell themes &amp; translations repository.

Upload translations in `/translations`. Upload themes in `/theme/(Theme-Name^Uploader)/`, containing all your theme files.

For themes, it is also appreciated to provide a preview as well (include `/theme/(Theme-Name^Uploader)/preview.jpg` and a README.MD with a short description and displaying the preview.png. [Example with CrysisShell.](https://github.com/xy2iii/vitashell-themes/tree/master/themes/CrysisShell-memomo) Sample README.md:
```
# (theme) by (author)

![Preview](https://github.com/xy2iii/vitashell-themes/tree/ma ster/themes/theme-author/preview.jpg)
```

For end users: for translations, put the desired translation(s) in `ux0:VitaShell/language/`. For themes, put the desired theme (the folder itself) in `ux0:VitaShell/theme/`. You can have multiple themes at once; just put all the themes you wish to use and swap with VitaShell.
