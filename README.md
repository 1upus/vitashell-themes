# vitashell-themes
VitaShell themes &amp; translations repository.

Upload translations in `/translations`. Upload themes in `/theme/(Theme Name-Uploader)/`, containing both `/theme/(Theme Name-Uploader)/colors.txt` and  `/theme/(Theme Name-Uploader)/wallpaper.png`. A wallpaper is not required.

For end users: for translations, put the desired translation(s) in `ux0:VitaShell/language/`. For themes, put the desired theme (the content of the folder of the theme you wish, not the folder itself) in `ux0:VitaShell/theme/`.
