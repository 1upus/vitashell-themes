# vitashell-themes
VitaShell themes &amp; translations repository.

Upload translations in `/translations`. Upload themes in `/theme/(Theme Name-Uploader)/`, containing both `/theme/(Theme Name-Uploader)/colors.txt` and  `/theme/(Theme Name-Uploader)/wallpaper.png`. A wallpaper is not required.

For themes, it is also appreciated to provide a preview as well (include `/theme/(Theme Name-Uploader)/preview.png` and a README.MD with a short description and displaying the preview.jpg. [Example with CrysisShell.](https://github.com/xy2iii/vitashell-themes/tree/master/themes/CrysisShell-memomo)

For end users: for translations, put the desired translation(s) in `ux0:VitaShell/language/`. For themes, put the desired theme (the content of the folder of the theme you wish, not the folder itself) in `ux0:VitaShell/theme/`.
